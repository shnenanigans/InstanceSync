# InstanceSync
### Syncs the config, mods, resourcepacks, and speedrunigt folders for multiple instances in minecraft speedrunning.


If the download warns you of a virus, this is most likely because the program is made to add, delete, and modify your files which windows antivirus doesn't like.


There are a couple things I highly recommend before running this program:
1. Group your instances in multimc, especially if you have a lot of them. You can then choose a group that has the instances you want to sync instead of manually selecting all of them.
2. Make a folder to put InstanceSync.exe in. This is because a new file will be created when you run it, which saves your multimc path so you don't have to search for it every time.


If you really, really don't want to download the .exe because of the virus warning you can download the source code instead. Type `pip install tkinter` in command prompt, and double click InstanceSync.py and it should work. Another option is to download the first release.
